## GitHub Branch Rules

- **Protected branches**: `main` and `develop` (no direct pushes, no deletions, admins enforced)
- **Workflow**: feature branch → PR → `develop` → PR → `main`
- **All branches** must come from `develop`
- **Never** push directly to `main` or `develop` - always create a feature branch first
